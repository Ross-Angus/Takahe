# Takahē
Takahē is a set of files which allows a web developer to put together a client-side XSLT site with all navigation in an external XML file. This site is both documentation of how to use Takahē, and a demonstration of what it can do.

[Full documentation of Takahē](http://labs.realise.com/rossa/takahe/) is available.

Takahē expects to sit in the root of a web server and assumes that the web server will serve index.xml files as default, inside directories. It will probably work if the file extension of the files is .html, but I've not tried this.
