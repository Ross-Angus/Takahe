		<h1>Navigation</h1>
		<p>All navigation data is in <a href="/data-structure/site/"><code>global.xml</code></a>. As this data is available to the <jargon type="XSLT"/>, it can be manipulated in a variety of ways. The main way this is done, is by comparing the navigation with the path to the current page.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, due to the restrictions of <jargon type="XSLT"/> 1, this string needs to be added manually to each page <jargon type="XML"/> file.</p>
