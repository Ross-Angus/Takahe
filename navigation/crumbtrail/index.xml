		<h1>Crumb trail</h1>
		<p>The <a href="/xslt-structure/templates/crumb-trail/">crumb trail template</a> works like a vertical slice through the current navigation. Each node, from the current page, up to the home page, is represented.</p>
		<p>Note that the home page is a sibling to all top-level pages. This approach isn't as pure as having all top-level pages as children of the home page. If a pure approach is required, changes will need to be made to the crumb trail template.</p>
		<p>The crumbtrail is controlled by <a href="/xslt-structure/templates/crumb-trail/">the <code>crumb-trail</code> template</a>.</p>
